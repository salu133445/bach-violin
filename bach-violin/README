Bach Violin Dataset
===================

The Bach Violin Dataset is a collection of high-quality public recordings of
Bach's sonatas and partitas for solo violin (BWV 1001–1006). The dataset
consists of 6.5 hours of professional recordings from 17 violinists recorded in
various recording setups. It also provides the reference scores and estimated
alignments between the recordings and scores.


Contents
--------

- All recordings are collected from the web. Their source URLs can be found in
  `audio.csv`. They come in either MP3 or OPUS format, depending on their
  sources.
- Each folder in the `audio` directory corresponds to a collection that contains
  recordings with similar recording setups except the `misc` folder. (Due to
  copyright concern, audio files in the collections 'shunske-sato' and
  'young-talents' need to be downloaded from YouTube.)
- The corresponding reference score for each recording can be found in
  `info.csv`. They come in MusicXML format, which can be opened with
  MuseScore (https://musescore.org/), music21 (https://web.mit.edu/music21/)
  and MusPy (https://salu133445.github.io/muspy/).
